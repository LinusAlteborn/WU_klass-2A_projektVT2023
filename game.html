                        Hello and welcome to my new and "improved" version of 8 ball pool.
                
                New update! Yay.
                ___________________________________________
                
                Instructions:
                Click and drag to pull the cue. Release to shoot.
                
                (Pull towards the cue)
                ___________________________________________
                
                8 Ball Pool rules:
                To win, a player must sink the 8 ball (the black ball). But first, you must sink all the red or blue balls depending on which color you got at the beginning.
                
                The color is decided by the first ball you sink, so if you sink a red ball first, your color is red, and if you sink a blue ball first, your color is blue.
                
                If the opposing player plays an illegal shot, you get the cue ball(white ball) in your hand. Click to place the ball anywhere you want.
                
                These are the illegal moves:
                *You sink the opponent's ball
                *You don't hit the right ball color first
                *You don't hit anything
                *You sink the cue ball
                
                These are the losing moves:
                *You sink the cue ball and 8 ball in the same shot
                *You sink the 8 ball before the others

                Info about the physics engine:
                
                Warning! This explanation is very bad and probably false. So please take everything with a grain of salt.
                
                I don't know what I'm doing, My brain is smooth, and I can't explain stuff very well.
                
                
                
                ...
                
                
                
                Anyway.
                
                Most physics engines use something called real-time physics. This means that the engine checks for collision on every frame and tries to push colliding objects out of each other.
                
                So, for example, an 8-ball pool engine using real-time physics would check for distances between the balls on every frame, and if the distance is smaller than 2r, they are colliding. (this is the method I used for my old 8-ball pool game)
                
                This method works fine for most applications. But it's not very accurate. If the speeds are too large or the frames are too low, then the physics just dies.
                
                
                
                The physics engine used in this game has a different approach. The collisions are not calculated on each frame. Instead, they are calculated before you even see the balls moving.
                
                I do this by using something called "the quartic formula." The result is that I have a function that can give me the time when 2 balls will collide in an instant.
                
                So instead of checking for collisions on every frame, I just calculate when they will collide with a function.
                
                This method can handle high speed with no issues and is super accurate.
                
                I also take advantage of this to make the bot better. The bot simulates many shots to find the best one. That's why it can take a while for it to think.
                
                This is a very brief explanation. I might make a video going into more detail about it.

    Note:
    *The bot is quite slow, but don't make fun of him, he's self-conscious. ok?
    *The shooting is delayed by about 1 second for performance reasons. sorry about that... /=
    
    Let me know if you find any glitches.

    2022-08-29 Bot optimization and progress bar
    2022-08-30 made the bot think less on easy/medium.
    2022-08-31 optimized the bot code
    2022-08-31 added a new difficulty, (Impossible.)

    I didn't steal the physics engine from a tutorial this time. So congrats to me, right?
    
    Anyway
    Have a good day,
    bye
